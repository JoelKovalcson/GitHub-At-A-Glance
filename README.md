# Programmer Dashboard

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://joelkovalcson.github.io/Programmer-Dashboard/).

This project was designed for a group to come up with an original application using 3rd party APIs.

Additional requirements for the project were as follows:
* Use a CSS framework besides Bootstrap
* Deploy the project to GitHub Pages
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)
* Use at least two server-side APIs
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals instead)
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data
* Be responsive
* Have a polished UI
